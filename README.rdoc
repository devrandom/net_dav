Net::Dav library, in the style of Net::HTTP {<img src="https://travis-ci.org/devrandom/net_dav.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status" />}[https://travis-ci.org/devrandom/net_dav]

== Install

Installing the gem:

  gem install net_dav

and if you want acceleration for large files (from 4MB/s to 20MB/s in my setup):

  gem install curb

If you're having install issues with nokogiri on Mac OS X read
http://wiki.github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/what-to-do-if-libxml2-is-being-a-jerk

== Usage
  require 'net/dav'

  Net::DAV.start("https://localhost.localdomain/xyz/") do |dav|
    dav.find('.', :recursive => true) do |item|
      item.content = item.content.gsub(/silly/i, 'funny')
    end
  end

(Note that if you want to use "." to refer to the origin URL, it should
end with a slash, otherwise it is assumed that the last component is a file
and "." will refer to the parent.)

== Performance

This should be threadsafe if you use a different Net::DAV object
for each thread.
Check out script/multi-test for a multi-threaded application.

Installing the +curb+ gem will gain speedup with large files, but currently
is much slower doing many small +get+ operations. If your usecase is the
latter and you have +curb+ installed, you can disable its use by passing the 
 :curl => false
option to Net::DAV::start or Net::DAV::new .

== Other

Thanks go to Thomas ( https://github.com/thomasfl/ ) and others for their help.

Thomas is writing the easy to use https://github.com/thomasfl/open-uri-and-write based on net_dav.
